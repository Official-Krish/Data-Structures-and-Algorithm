    Given a string, find the minimum number of insertions needed to make it a palindrome.

    Sample Input: "abcde"
    Sample Output: 4
    Explanation: The minimum insertions required are 'edcb' -> "abcdecb", resulting in a palindrome.

    Approach:
    We can solve this problem using dynamic programming.
    Let's define a 2D table, dp, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of insertions needed to make the substring from index i to j a palindrome.
    If the characters at indices i and j are equal, then dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1].
    Otherwise, we have two options:
        1. Insert the character at index i at the end, i.e., dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1.
        2. Insert the character at index j at the beginning, i.e., dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j] + 1.
    We take the minimum of these two options as the minimum number of insertions required for the substring from index i to j.
    Finally, the minimum number of insertions needed for the entire string is dp[0][n-1], where n is the length of the string.

    Time complexity: O(n^2)
    Space complexity: O(n^2)

                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1];

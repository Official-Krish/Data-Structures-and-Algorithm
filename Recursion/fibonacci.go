// Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence,
// in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
// The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence
// from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1,
// the first few values in the sequence are:
// 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.

// Sample Input: 5
// Output: 5
// Sample Input: 7
// Output: 13

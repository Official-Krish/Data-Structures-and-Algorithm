   Time Complexity: O(nlog(n)), Space Complexity: O(n)

   Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
   The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).
   You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
   
   Example 1:
   Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
   Output: [[-2,2]] 
   
   Explanation:
   The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
   The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
   Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
   We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
   

   Example 2:
   Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
   Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]

   Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

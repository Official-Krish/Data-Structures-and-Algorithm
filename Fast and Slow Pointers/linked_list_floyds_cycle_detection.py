     Floyds Cycle detection and removal
     Program Author : Abhisek Kumar Gupta 
     The cycle detection problem is to find the cycle in a sequence, 
     and Floydâ€™s cycle detection algorithm, aka Tortoise and Hare algorithm, 
     is a two-pointer algorithm to detect the cycle and locate the start of the cycle as well.
